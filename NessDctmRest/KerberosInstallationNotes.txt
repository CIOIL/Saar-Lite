
1. Tomcat should be configured to work with Kerberos. (Currently in VCAC it is saar-test-web01 Tomcat 7.1)
2. Configuration should be tested with webtop. I.e. webtop should properly work with Kerberos auth.
3. Should be sure that superuser.properties contains existing user(s). 
4. Kerberos.properties should contains proper domain. E.g. domain=XXX
5. ExtDocConfig.js should contains: 
    --- authenticationType: 'kerberos';
    --- restUrl:  'http://XXX/NessDctmRest/' (important that server name is full i.e. contains domain) 
6. Same about saarlite url -- should contains domain    
7. In VCAC for testing simplifying basic authentication add 
   --- open war by starting Tomcat or using archiver app
   --- remove SaarLite.war from webapps
   --- copy SaarLite folder and give it name SaarLiteB
   --- inside SaarLiteB change in ExtDocConfig.js to authenticationType: 'basic'.
